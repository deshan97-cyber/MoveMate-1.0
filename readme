üì° MoveMate 1.0
This project is a multifunctional ESP32-based IoT system designed to monitor human activity (step counting), environmental conditions (temperature and humidity), and battery health, while supporting offline data storage, real-time data transmission via MQTT, OLED visualization, and web-based monitoring.

üîß Features
Step Counting with MPU6050
Detects walking and running steps based on calibrated thresholds.

Temperature & Humidity Monitoring
Reads values using the DHT11 sensor.

OLED Display (SSD1306)
Shows live step count, temperature, humidity, time, mode, and battery status.

Wi-Fi Auto-Connect & MQTT Communication
Connects to multiple known Wi-Fi networks and MQTT brokers to publish sensor data.

Offline Data Logging (SPIFFS)
Stores data locally when MQTT is unavailable and automatically resends it once reconnected.

Battery Monitoring
Calculates battery percentage and indicates low battery via LED alert.

Time Synchronization (NTP)
Retrieves and displays real-time clock data.

Push Button Controls

Start button to toggle modes (OFF ‚Üí WALKING ‚Üí RUNNING)

Web Interface via AsyncWebServer
View live data or saved offline data through the ESP32's local web server.
